    <h1>Do Not Play <i>Fear & Hunger</i></h1>
    <p>This website is dedicated to explaining why you should not play this game.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>"It seems like every other amateur RPG Maker game. What's the deal?"</h2>
    <p>I bet you thought the same with Doki-Doki Literature Club. Never played that either? Good, don't. You will have random moments throughout your life where you are reminded of the very first "scene" that makes you regret having clicked "Play," so don't, m'kay?</p>
    <br>

    <h2>"C'mon, it can't be that bad"</h2>
    <p>I would forbid my grandparents from playing this game.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>"You're being hyperbolic"</h2>
    <p>You ever think to yourself, "Man, I really wish there was something more depressing than <u>Berserker</u> and difficult than <u>Dark Souls</u>"? No, you haven't, because no sane person thinks this. Ever.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>"Hey, that actually sounds pretty cool! I love those!"</h2>
    <p>I do too, but this is pushing the boundaries between art and smutty content, or challenging and sadism. It's deeply disturbing, and even those aforementioned titles are hard to endure psychologically in extremely different ways.</p>

    <h2>"Thank you for the warning. I will be leaving now."</h2>
    <p>You are more than welcome. Go to the <a href="safe.html" title="The safest of havens">Safe</a> page to have some substantially better games.</p>

    <h2>"I appreciate the warnings. I still want to play."</h2>
    <p>More power to you; I did my good deed to humanity. I <i>do</i> believe this is a great game, pushing everything else aside. I truly would never recommend this to anyone that doesn't have the stomach for gruesome content or harsh topics, so if you must, I'd recommend two things:</p>
    <pre>
        <ol>
            <li>Apologize profusely to your computer for downloading the abomination you are about to put onto it.</li>
            <li>Head over to the <a href="mods.html" title="May higher entities have mercy on your soul">Mods</a> page.</li>
        </ol>
